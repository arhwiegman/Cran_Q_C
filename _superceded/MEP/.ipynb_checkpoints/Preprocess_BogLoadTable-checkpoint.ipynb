    "Embayment | Char | Name of the Embayment that the bog drains to | \n",
    "Region | Char | e.g. Buzzards Bay, Islands, Cape Cod | \n",
    "Status | Character | Active or Retired | \n",
    "In_Terminus | binary 1 or 0 | Bogs that fall in the bottom 5th percentile of elevation of their subcatchment | In terminus bogs are assumed to recieve the full proportion of their topograhic drainage area (Drainage_Area_m2)\n",
    "Surface_Area_m2 | m-2 | The cranberry bog surface area from the WMAbogs layer polygons |\n",
    "Drainage_Area_m2| m-2 | The topographic drainage area estimate for the bog | we need to be wary of groundwater underflow in Terminus vs Non terminus bogs \n",

    "Q_m3d | m-3 d | Estimated discharge through bog, the product of Recharge_Rate_MEP and Drainage_Area_m2 | this may be an over estimate due to groundwater underflow\n",
    "HLR_md | m d-1 | Hydraulic loading rate = Q / Surface_Area | This is important design parameter for wetland restoration\n",
    "HRT_10cm_d | d | Hydraulic residence time with an average depth of 10cm over the entire bog surface area | \n",
    "Area_HLR_lt_0p1 |  m2  |  Area required to achieve hydraulic loading rate less than 0.1 m-2 per day | Crumpton et al. suggest that the odds of removal efficiencies greater than 40% go up when HLR < 0.1\n",
