Added new scripts to plot reductions as a function of farm status. 
- for the calculation of fertilizer, only active farms in the cranberry layer are considered
- for S2 indicate if the best bog was retired or active. 

# 2024-11-14

Began the process of organizing scripts for publication and data release.
the main changes were to the 2_gis and 3_post folders. 

# 2024-09-03

Not sure why some bogs are going missing. There must be an issue with a join.

Changing the flow rounting model to a GW and Lidar hybrid where GW depth is less than 1m.
Added functions for modeling nutrient uptake using TIS and walton et al. 
Tested modifications to NHD burn lines. 


# Planned Changes for Fall 2023:

- Create folder with all relevant data and scripts
- Clean scripts and rerun analyses
- Specific changes 

0_raw
- add all input data

1_prep
- incorperate new NO3/TN data from USGS and buzzards bay
- summarize N trends regionally and over time 
- incorperate tidmarsh into Q data
- rerun scripts

2_gis
- Bogs
	- remove artifacts from original bog polygons
- NO3_TN 
	- krigging
	- explore other NO3 models
- Q
	- flow accumulation
	- Adjust for wells zone2/zone1
	- Compare pumping rate to recharge rate times area. 

3_post
	- Verification
		- NO3 observed vs predicted
		- Q observed vs predicted
	- Rerun analysis scripts
